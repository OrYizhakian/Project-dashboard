Gatling:
Using our pc directly:
We found that max limit is around 560~, but when trying that times 1.1 we didn't fail.
However if we choose 580, trying that times 1.1 will start getting failures.
We're assuming that under small load 580 is a good number, but heavy load lowers us to 560~.
So for stress test we'll do 580>638>580>638>0 during 4 minutes.
If we want to distribute even times, ramp will be 10 seconds, and each test will hold for
38 seconds.

For load we'll just do 522 and expect it to work properly over 5 minutes.
We can set ramp up time for load test at 30 seconds (and teardown)

We did all that directly through CMD, but when we tried with jenkins it ran differently.
Using Jenkins to run gatling:

We tried to find jenkins's max limit but failed, and we tried a lot.
We made the scenarios to work and look like the correct tests, but in the end we didn't succeed in finding max limit.
Our problem was we got random errors when testing different values, but no value gave us consistent errors.

Our .HAR file was just accessing the site, which triggered 20 requests.

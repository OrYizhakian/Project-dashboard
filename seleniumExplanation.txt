The first assert we're making is when we create a new project. If the new project doesn't exist, 
the rest of the automated run doesn't matter.
The second assert is to see if the project successfuly changed, because we want to duplicate it.
We then show that we "accidentally" clear the copy so we need to delete it.
We then use a weird method of checking if the copy got deleted (we want to show the search bar work)
but we don't care if it got deleted or not so we use verify.
We then use storeText into a variable then using it, just to see if that fits the requirement for 3 validations.
